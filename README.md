I have always battled to see finished dimensions on a picture or plan for a woodworking project, and need to roughly relate this to timber sizes that are available at the woodshop.
This application using AI makes it easy because I add finished dimensions on one side, rough timber sizes on the other and it calculates how many of what size is needed. 
Also produces cutting dimensions for each piece of timber.
